	<h2>Familiarity</h2>
		<p>Back home from getting her master's degree in potion brewing,
		   Molly Pond has returned to her hometown with
		   her Familiar, Aubergine, to start their brewery. Her life’s dream
		   is to be a famous brewer, just like her grandmother;
		   Aubergine has helped her every step of the way, as any good Witch’s Familiar
		   worth their salt would be.<br>
		   Business is slow back in Calchester, and their home has changed so much
		   since she left for University. Curses are stewing around them:
		   malignant magic is polluting and rotting at the forest; the mayor is
		   doing nothing to stop it.<br>
		   It’s up to Molly and Aubergine to step up with other residents to protect
		   their once gentle, sleepy town from the conspiracies broiling in its underbelly...</p>
